UI Design 
Imagine your app as a journey
The app designer is your guide that guides the users attention
Attention is always drawn to size first
Great design: gives subconcious clues about how the user should interact with the application
Material Design: google, things look like they're appearing on paper or other materials - give a hint of interactivity

Alignment = KEY
single line touching all edges
minimize the number of alignment lines
edge alignement
center alignment

UI Research
